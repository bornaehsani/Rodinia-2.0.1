 - 92.5% of time is spent in three functions:
Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.

- OMP run on CPU:
 -maybe 30% speedup on four cores vs one core

-profile run on GPU
 -only ~15% of total time is on the gpu
-find key kernels
 -mummergpuKernel
 -printKernel
-what is the GPU parallelization strategy?
 -
-decide what to include in timing info
-look at Parboil for list of things to time separately
